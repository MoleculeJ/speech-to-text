# speech-to-text



Here are my expansive thoughts. 
I think the transcript the Whisper produces is readable. I cross-checked the text line by line with the original video, and it's perfectly accurate. Still, I think the timestamp is a little bit confusing, and I am curious about how to apply this tool to create closed captions and put them back in the video with the correct timestamp.
